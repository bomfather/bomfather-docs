This is the second placeholder entry for validating the updated blog index layout. Use it to confirm:

1. Dividers appear between consecutive posts
2. Titles break onto multiple lines gracefully
3. Excerpt length feels balanced against the title size

Weâ€™ll replace this with a real article once the layout is approved.

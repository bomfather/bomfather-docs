This is a placeholder article. It exists to help verify spacing, typography, and dividers in the blog index.

- Check vertical rhythm between the date/author line, title and excerpt
- Confirm divider lines render above and below
- Ensure hover styles on “Read Article” remain subtle

Nothing to see here beyond layout QA.

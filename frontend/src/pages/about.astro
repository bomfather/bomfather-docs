        <h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold mb-6 mt-12">Our Story — Building Runtime Trust for AI</h2>
        <p class="text-lg mb-6">
          A critical red-team exercise of ours revealed what others missed, attackers could silently swap model weights post-deployment without detection. While traditional security stops at code review, we discovered the real threats emerge during runtime.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg mb-6">
          Bomfather was born from this revelation. Our proprietary technology leverages eBPF within the Linux kernel to create a Merkle tree security architecture that monitors, protects, and comprehensively logs every file access, GPU call, and system interaction in real-time. This cryptographic chain not only detects unauthorized changes—to models, data, or libraries—but actively protects against them while maintaining immutable records of all system activities.
